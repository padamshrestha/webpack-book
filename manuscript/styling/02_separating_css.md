# Separating CSS

Even though we have a nice build set up now, where did all the CSS go? As per our configuration, it has been inlined to JavaScript! Even though this can be convenient during development, it doesn't sound ideal.

The current solution doesn't allow us to cache CSS. In some cases, we might suffer from a **Flash of Unstyled Content** (FOUC). FOUC happens because the browser will take a while to load JavaScript and the styles would be applied only then. Separating CSS to a file of its own avoids the problem by letting the browser to manage it separately.

Webpack provides a means to generate a separate CSS bundles using [ExtractTextPlugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-text-webpack-plugin). It can aggregate multiple CSS files into one. For this reason, it comes with a loader that handles the extraction process. The plugin then picks up the result aggregated by the loader and emits a separate file.

Due to this process, `ExtractTextPlugin` comes with overhead during the compilation phase. It won't work with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) by design. Given we are using it only for production, that won't be a problem.

T> This same technique can be employed with other assets, like templates, too.

W> It can be potentially dangerous to use inline styles within JavaScript in production as it represents an attack vector. **Critical path rendering** embraces the idea and inlines the critical CSS to the initial HTML payload improving perceived performance of the site. It is discussed in the next chapter in detail. In limited contexts inlining a small amount of CSS can be a viable option to speed up the initial load (fewer requests).

## Setting Up `ExtractTextPlugin`

It will take some configuration to make it work. Install the plugin:

```bash
npm install extract-text-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

`ExtractTextPlugin` includes a loader, `ExtractTextPlugin.extract` that marks the assets to be extracted. Then a plugin will perform its work based on this annotation.

`ExtractTextPlugin.extract` accepts `use` and `fallback` definitions. `ExtractTextPlugin` processes content through `use` only from **initial chunks** by default and it uses `fallback` for the rest. It won't touch any split bundles unless `allChunks: true` is set true. The *Splitting Bundles* chapter digs into greater detail.

It is important to note that if you wanted to extract CSS from a more involved format, like Sass, you would have to pass multiple loaders to the `use` option. Both `use` and `fallback` accept a loader (string), a loader definition, or an array of loader definitions.

The idea looks like this:

**webpack.parts.js**

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');
leanpub-start-insert
const ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');
leanpub-end-insert

...

leanpub-start-insert
exports.extractCSS = function({ include, exclude, use }) {
  // Output extracted CSS to a file
  const plugin = new ExtractTextPlugin({
    filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].css',
  });

  return {
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.css$/,
          include,
          exclude,

          use: plugin.extract({
            use,
            fallback: 'style-loader',
          }),
        },
      ],
    },
    plugins: [ plugin ],
  };
};
leanpub-end-insert
```

That `[name]` placeholder will use the name of the entry where the CSS is referred. Placeholders and the overall idea are discussed in detail at the *Adding Hashes to Filenames* chapter.

T> If you wanted to output the resulting file to a specific directory, you could do it like this: `new ExtractTextPlugin('styles/[name].css')`.

T> If you extract multiple CSS files from separate entries, you can use [merge-files-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/merge-files-webpack-plugin) to concatenate them into one file.

### Connecting with Configuration

Connect the function with our configuration as below:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

const commonConfig = merge([
  {
    ...
  },
leanpub-start-delete
  parts.loadCSS(),
leanpub-end-delete
]);

const productionConfig = merge([
leanpub-start-insert
  parts.extractCSS({ use: 'css-loader' }),
leanpub-end-insert
]);

const developmentConfig = merge([
  ...
leanpub-start-insert
  parts.loadCSS(),
leanpub-end-insert
]);

...
```

Using this setup, we can still benefit from the HMR during development. For a production build, we generate a separate CSS, though. *html-webpack-plugin* will pick it up automatically and inject it into our `index.html`.

T> If you are using CSS Modules, remember to tweak `use` accordingly as discussed in the *Loading Styles* chapter. You may also want to maintain separate setups for normal CSS and CSS Modules so that they get loaded through separate logic.

After running `npm run build`, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash
Hash: 57e54590377069688806
Version: webpack 2.2.1
Time: 952ms
     Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    app.js    3.79 kB       0  [emitted]  app
   app.css   32 bytes       0  [emitted]  app
index.html  218 bytes          [emitted]
   [0] ./app/component.js 148 bytes {0} [built]
   [1] ./app/main.css 41 bytes {0} [built]
   [2] ./app/index.js 434 bytes {0} [built]
...
```

Now our styling has been pushed to a separate CSS file. Thus, our JavaScript bundle has become slightly smaller. We also avoid the FOUC problem. The browser doesn't have to wait for JavaScript to load to get styling information. Instead, it can process the CSS separately, avoiding the flash.

T> If you are getting `Module build failed: CssSyntaxError:` or `Module build failed: Unknown word` error, make sure your `common` configuration doesn't have a CSS-related section set up.

T> [extract-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-loader) is a light alternative to `ExtractTextPlugin`. It does less, but can be enough for basic extraction needs.

## Managing Styles Outside of JavaScript

Even though referring to styling through JavaScript and then bundling is a valid option, it is possible to achieve the same result through an `entry` and [globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob). The basic idea goes like this:

```javascript
...
const glob = require('glob');

// Glob CSS files as an array of CSS files. This can be
// potentially problematic due to CSS rule ordering so
// be careful!
const PATHS = {
  app: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),
  build: path.join(__dirname, 'build'),
  style: glob.sync('./app/**/*.css'),
};

...

const commonConfig = merge([
  {
    entry: {
      app: PATHS.app,
      style: PATHS.style,
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
]);
```

After this type of change, you would not have to refer to styling from your application code. It also means that CSS Modules won't work anymore. As a result, you should get both *style.css* and *style.js*. The latter file will contain roughly content like `webpackJsonp([1,3],[function(n,c){}]);` and it doesn't do anything useful as discussed in [webpack issue 1967](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1967).

The approach can be useful if you have to port a legacy project relying on CSS concatenation. If you want strict control over the ordering, you can set up a single CSS entry and then use `@import` to bring the rest to the project through it. Another option would be to set up a JavaScript entry and go through `import` to get the same effect.

## Conclusion

Our current setup separates styling from JavaScript neatly. Even though the technique is most useful with CSS, it can be used to extract HTML templates or any other files types you might consume. The hard part about `ExtractTextPlugin` has to do with its setup, but the complexity can be hidden behind an abstraction.

To recap:

* Using `ExtractTextPlugin` with styling solves the problem of Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). Separating CSS from JavaScript also improves caching behavior and removes a potential attack vector.
* `ExtractTextPlugin` is not the only way to handle the problem. *extract-loader* can give the same result in more limited contexts.
* If you don't prefer to maintain references to styling through JavaScript, an alternative is to handle them through an entry. You will have to be careful with style ordering in this case, though.

In the next chapter, we will discuss a technique known as **autoprefixing**. Enabling the feature will make it more convenient to develop complex CSS setups that work with older browsers as well.
