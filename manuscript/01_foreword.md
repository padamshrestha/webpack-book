# Foreword

It's a funny story how I started with webpack. Before getting addicted to JavaScript, I also developed in Java. I tried GWT (Google Web Toolkit) in that time. GWT is a Java-to-JavaScript Compiler, which has a great feature: [code splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html). I liked this feature and missed it in existing JavaScript Tooling. I made a Pull Request to an existing module bundler, but it did not go through. Webpack was born.

Somehow the Instagram frontend team discovered an early version of webpack and started to use it for instagram.com. Pete Hunt, Facebook employee managing the Instagram web team, gave [the first significant talk about webpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkTCL6Nqm6Y) at OSCON 2014. The talk boosted the popularity of webpack. It is interesting that one of the reasons for adoption of webpack by Instagram was **code splitting**.

I have been following this book since its early stages. It was once a combined React & webpack book. It has grown since then and become a book of its own filled with plenty of useful content.

Juho is an important part of the webpack documentation team for the webpack 2 documentation, so he knows best what complements the official documentation best. And he used this information to create this book in a format that is suitable to learn webpack and how to use it for good.
