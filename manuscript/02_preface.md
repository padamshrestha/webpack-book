# Preface

The book you are reading right now goes years back. It all started from a comment I made at Christian Alfoni's blog in 2014. I had recently discovered webpack and React, and I felt there was a need for a cookbook about the topics. We started writing it as a GitHub wiki early 2015.

After a while, I realized this should become an actual book and tried pitching it to a known publisher. As they weren't interested yet I felt the book has to happen, I started an effort known as **SurviveJS**. The book warped into "SurviveJS - Webpack and React", my first self-published book. It combined the two topics into one single book.

Given a book focusing only on a single technology can stand taller, I ended up splitting the book into two separate ones in 2016. The current book represents the webpack portion of it, and it has grown significantly due to this greater focus. The journey has not been easy nor a short one, but it has been possible thanks to community support and continued interest in the topic.

During these years webpack has transformed as a project. Instead of relying on a single prolific author, a core team including myself has grown around the project, and it has attracted more people around it to support the effort.

We are running an [open collective campaign](https://opencollective.com/webpack) to help the project to succeed financially. Also, I am donating 30% of the book earnings to Tobias as he has more than earned it. By supporting the book, you literally support webpack development as most of the profit goes to its core team.
