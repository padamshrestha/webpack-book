# Setting Environment Variables

Sometimes a part of your code should execute only during development. Or you might have experimental features in your build that are not ready for production yet. This code should not end up in the production build.

As JavaScript minifiers can remove dead code (`if (false)`), we can build on top of this idea and write code that gets transformed into this form. Webpack's `DefinePlugin` enables replacing **free variables** so that we can convert `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')` kind of code to `if (true)` or `if (false)` depending on the environment.

You can find packages that rely on this behavior. React is perhaps the most known example of an early adopter of the technique. Using `DefinePlugin` can bring down the size of your React production build somewhat as a result, and you may see a similar effect with other packages as well.

## The Basic Idea of `DefinePlugin`

To understand the idea of `DefinePlugin` better, consider the example below:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free due to "foo" above, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// Free since we don't refer to "bar", ok to replace
if (bar === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}
```

If we replaced `bar` with a string like `'foobar'`, then we would end up with code like this:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free due to "foo" above, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// Free since we don't refer to "bar", ok to replace
if ('foobar' === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}
```

Further analysis shows that `'foobar' === 'bar'` equals `false` so a minifier gives us:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free due to "foo" above, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// Free since we don't refer to "bar", ok to replace
if (false) {
  console.log('bar');
}
```

And based on this a minifier can eliminate the `if` statement as it has become dead code:

```javascript
var foo;

// Not free, not ok to replace
if (foo === 'bar') {
  console.log('bar');
}

// if (false) means the block can be dropped entirely
```

Elimination is the core idea of `DefinePlugin`. We can toggle parts of code using this kind of mechanism. A good minifier can perform the analysis for us and enable/disable entire portions of the code as we prefer.

## Setting `process.env.NODE_ENV`

Given we are using React in our project and it happens to use the technique, we can try to enable `DefinePlugin` and see what it does to our production build.

As before, encapsulate this idea to a function. It is important to note that given the way webpack replaces the free variable, we should push it through `JSON.stringify`. We'll end up with a string like `'"demo"'` and then webpack will insert that into the slots it finds.

**webpack.parts.js**

```javascript
...

exports.setFreeVariable = function(key, value) {
  const env = {};
  env[key] = JSON.stringify(value);

  return {
    plugins: [
      new webpack.DefinePlugin(env),
    ],
  };
};
```

We can connect this with our configuration like this:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

const productionConfig = merge([
  ...
leanpub-start-insert
  parts.setFreeVariable(
    'process.env.NODE_ENV',
    'production'
  ),
leanpub-end-insert
]);

...
```

Execute `npm run build` and you should see improved results:

```bash

                 0.js.map  768 bytes       0  [emitted]
               app.js.map    6.45 kB       1  [emitted]  app
              app.css.map   84 bytes       1  [emitted]  app
            vendor.js.map     286 kB       2  [emitted]  vendor
               index.html  274 bytes          [emitted]
  [14] ./app/component.js 461 bytes {1} [built]
  [15] ./app/shake.js 138 bytes {1} [built]
  [16] ./~/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css 41 bytes {1} [built]
...
```

We went from 150 kB to 45 kB, and finally, to 25 kB. The final build is a little faster than the previous one as well.

Given the 25 kB can be served gzipped, it is somewhat reasonable. gzipping will drop around another 40%, and it is well supported by browsers.

It is good to remember that we didn't include *react-dom* in this case and that would add around 100 kB to the final result. To get back to these figures, we would have to use a lighter alternative such as Preact or react-lite as discussed at the *Consuming Packages* chapter.

T> [babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables) Babel plugin can be used to achieve the same effect. See [the official documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-inline-environment-variables/) for details. [babel-plugin-transform-define](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-define) and [babel-plugin-minify-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-minify-replace) are other options.

T> `webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(['NODE_ENV'])` is a shortcut that allows you to refer to environment variables. It uses `DefinePlugin` underneath and you can achieve the same effect by passing `process.env.NODE_ENV` to the custom function we made. The [documentation covers `EnvironmentPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/) in greater detail.

## Choosing Which Module to Use Based on the Environment

The techniques discussed in this chapter can be useful for choosing entire modules depending on the environment. As seen above, `DefinePlugin` based splitting allows us to choose which branch of code to use and which to discard. This idea can be used to implement branching on module level. Consider the file structure below:

```bash
.
└── store
    ├── index.js
    ├── store.dev.js
    └── store.prod.js
```

The idea is that we will choose either `dev` or `prod` version of the store depending on the environment. It's that *index.js* which does the hard work like this:

```javascript
if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  module.exports = require('./store.prod');
} else {
  module.exports = require('./store.dev');
}
```

Webpack can pick the right code based on our `DefinePlugin` declaration and this code. It is good to note that we will have to use CommonJS module definition style here: ES6 `import`s don't allow dynamic behavior like this by design.

T> A related technique, **aliasing**, is discussed at the *Consuming Packages* chapter. You could alias to development or production particular file depending on the environment. The problem is that it will tie your setup to webpack in a tighter way than the solution above.

## Webpack Optimization Plugins

Webpack includes a collection of optimization related plugins, some of which we'll cover in detail in this book. Also, there are some outside the core. I've listed the most important ones below:

* [compression-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression-webpack-plugin) allows you to push the problem of generating compressed files to webpack to potentially save processing time on the server.
* `webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin` allows you to minify output using different heuristics. Some of them might break code unless you are careful.
* `webpack.optimize.AggressiveSplittingPlugin` allows you to split code into smaller bundles as discussed at the *Splitting Bundles* chapter. The result can be particularly useful in a HTTP/2 environment.
* `webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin` makes it possible to extract common dependencies into bundles of their own.
* `webpack.DefinePlugin` allows you to use feature flags in your code and eliminate the redundant code as discussed in this chapter.
* [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-webpack-plugin) creates smaller Lodash builds by replacing feature sets with smaller alternatives leading to more compact builds.

## Conclusion

Setting environment variables is a technique that allows you to control which paths of the source are included in the build. The process enables production specific optimizations and feature flags.

To recap:

* Webpack allows you to set environment variables through `DefinePlugin` and `EnvironmentPlugin`. Latter is a wrapper for `DefinePlugin` that maps system level environment variables to the source.
* `DefinePlugin` operates based on **free variables** and it will replace them as webpack analyzes the source code.
* Given minifiers eliminate dead code, using the plugins allows you to remove the code from the resulting build.
* The plugins enable module level patterns. By implementing a wrapper, you can choose which file webpack will include to the resulting build.
* In addition to these plugins, you can find other optimization related plugins that allow you to control the build result in many ways.

To ensure the build has good cache invalidation behavior, we'll include hashes to the generated filenames in the next chapter. This way the client will notice if assets have changed and can fetch the updated versions.
