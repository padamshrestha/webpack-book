# Adding Hashes to Filenames

Even though our build generates fine now, the naming it uses is a little problematic. It doesn't allow us to leverage client level cache effectively as there's no easy way to tell whether or not a file has changed. Cache invalidation can be achieved by including a hash to filenames.

## Placeholders

Webpack provides **placeholders** for this purpose. These strings are used to attach specific information to webpack output. The most useful ones are:

* `[path]` - Returns the file path.
* `[name]` - Returns the file name.
* `[ext]` - Returns the extension. `[ext]` works for most available fields. `ExtractTextPlugin` is a notable exception to this rule.
* `[hash]` - Returns the build hash. If any portion of the build changes, this will change as well.
* `[chunkhash]` - Returns an entry chunk-specific hash. Each `entry` defined at the configuration receives a hash of own. If any portion of the entry changes, the hash will change as well. `[chunkhash]` is more granular than `[hash]` by definition.
* `[contenthash]` - Returns a hash specific to content. `[contenthash]` is available for `ExtractTextPlugin` only and is the most specific option available.

It is preferable to use particularly `hash` and `chunkhash` only for production purposes as hashing won't do much good during development.

T> It is possible to slice `hash` and `chunkhash` using syntax like this: `[chunkhash:8]`. Instead of a hash like `8c4cbfdb91ff93f3f3c5` this would yield `8c4cbfdb`.

T> There are more options available, and you can even modify the hashing and digest type as discussed at [loader-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loader-utils#interpolatename) documentation.

### Example Placeholders

Assuming we have a configuration like this:

```javascript
{
  output: {
    path: PATHS.build,
    filename: '[name].[chunkhash].js',
  },
},
```

Webpack would generate filenames like these:

```bash
app.d587bbd6e38337f5accd.js
vendor.dc746a5db4ed650296e1.js
```

If the file contents related to a chunk are different, the hash will change as well, thus invalidating the cache. More accurately, the browser will send a new request for the new file. If only `app` bundle gets updated, only that file needs to be requested again.

An alternate way to achieve the same result would be to generate static filenames and invalidate the cache through a querystring (i.e., `app.js?d587bbd6e38337f5accd`). The part behind the question mark will invalidate the cache. According to [Steve Souders](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/), attaching the hash to the filename is the more performant way to go.

## Setting Up Hashing

The build needs tweaking to generate proper hashes. Images and fonts should receive `hash` while chunks should use `chunkhash` in their names to invalidate them correctly:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

const commonConfig = {
  ...
  parts.loadFonts({
    options: {
leanpub-start-delete
      name: '[name].[ext]',
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
      name: '[name].[hash:8].[ext]',
leanpub-end-insert
    },
  }),
  ...
};

const productionConfig = merge([
  {
    ...
leanpub-start-insert
    output: {
      chunkFilename: '[name].[chunkhash:8].js',
      filename: '[name].[chunkhash:8].js',
    },
leanpub-end-insert
  },
  ...
  parts.loadImages({
    options: {
      limit: 15000,
leanpub-start-delete
      name: '[name].[ext]',
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
      name: '[name].[hash:8].[ext]',
leanpub-end-insert
    },
  }),
  ...
]);

...
```

If we used `chunkhash` for the extracted CSS as well, this would lead to problems as our code points to the CSS through JavaScript bringing it to the same entry. That means if the application code or CSS changed, it would invalidate both. Therefore, instead of `chunkhash`, we can use `contenthash` that's generated based on the extracted content:

**webpack.parts.js**

```javascript
...

exports.extractCSS = function({ include, exclude, use }) {
  // Output extracted CSS to a file
  const plugin = new ExtractTextPlugin({
leanpub-start-delete
    filename: '[name].css',
leanpub-end-delete
leanpub-start-insert
    filename: '[name].[contenthash:8].css',
leanpub-end-insert
  });

  ...
};

...
```

W> The hashes have been sliced to make the output fit better in the book. In practice, you can skip slicing them.

If you generate a build now (`npm run build`), you should see something like this:

```bash

Version: webpack 2.2.1
Time: 3586ms
                 Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names

  [15] ./app/shake.js 138 bytes {1} [built]
  [16] ./~/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css 41 bytes {1} [built]
...
```

Our files have neat hashes now. To prove that it works for styling, you could try altering *app/main.css* and see what happens to the hashes when you rebuild.

There's one problem, though. If you change the application code, it will invalidate the vendor file as well! Solving this requires extracting a **manifest**, but before that, we can improve the way the production build handles module IDs.

T> The length of hashes has been clamped to eight characters to fit the output to the book better. In practice, you could avoid it and skip using `:8`.

## Enabling `HashedModuleIdsPlugin`

As you might remember, webpack uses number based IDs for the module code it generates. The problem is that they are difficult to work with and can lead to difficult to debug issues, particularly with hashing. Like we did with the development setup earlier, we can perform a simplification here as well.

Webpack provides `HashedModuleIdsPlugin` that is like `NamedModulesPlugin` except it hashes the result and hides the path information. The process keeps module IDs stable as they aren't derived based on order. We sacrifice a couple of bytes for a cleaner setup, but the trade-off is well worth it.

The change required is tiny. Tweak the configuration as follows:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
...

const productionConfig = merge([
  {
    ...
leanpub-start-insert
    plugins: [
      new webpack.HashedModuleIdsPlugin(),
    ],
leanpub-end-insert
  },
  ...
]);

...
```

As you can see in the build output, the difference is negligible:

```bash

Time: 3443ms
                 Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names

...
```

Note how the output has changed, though. Instead of numbers, you can see hashes. But this is expected given the change we made.

## Conclusion

Including hashes related to the file, contents is a good way to invalidate them on the client side. If a hash has changed, the client will be forced to download the asset again.

To recap:

* Webpack's **placeholders** allow you to shape filenames and enable you to include hashes to them.
* The most useful placeholders are `[name]`, `[chunkhash]`, and `[ext]`. `chunkhash` is derived based on the entry in which the asset belongs.
* If you are using `ExtractTextPlugin`, you should use `[contenthash]`. This way extracted assets won't become invalidated even if the entries from which they were extracted change.
* `HashedModuleIdsPlugin` provides a way to generate module IDs based on module paths. This is more stable than relying on the default order based numeric module IDs.

Even though the project generates hashes now, the output isn't flawless. The problem is that if the application changes, it will invalidate the vendor bundle as well. The next chapter digs deeper into the topic and shows you how to extract a **manifest** to resolve the issue.
